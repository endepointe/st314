Lesson 1: Intro to Probability

	Probability is needed for determining the liklihood that an event will occur.

	Some of the basic rules for probabiliy are finding the sample space first, then calculating the liklihood that events will occur.

	A complement is the liklihood that an event will not happen.

	Sample space is the total number of possible events. Events are a subset of sample space type. Probability is the liklihood that an event will occur within the sample space.


Lesson 2: Set Theory and Probability

	A Venn Diagram is red and blue make purple. two sebsets that produce a smaller subset with the same outcome.

	Set Theory is . It contains the following notation:

		Event - a collection of outcomes within a sample space. (simple-one, compound-many).
		Sample Space - set of all possible outcomes of that experiment 
		Intersection - two or more events have the same outcome. A and B 
		Mutually Exclusive - an intesection has no outcomes. disjoint, null
		Union - A or B
		Complement - A' is a complement of A

	Describe Probability using Set Theory

	The General Addition Rule is: P(a) + P(b) - P(a && b)

Lesson 3: Conditional Probability

	Conditional Probability represents the probability, P, that an event, A, will occur, when another event, B, has occurred. P(A | B) reads "the probability that A will occur when B has occurred.
